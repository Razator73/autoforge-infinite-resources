# Infinite Resources

### Autoforge 0.4.0

<br>

> The purpose of this mod is to make all the back wall resources infinite (when mined with a drill). I haven't got to liquids yet so they may not be infinite. Letting you set up mega factories without worrying about the drills running dry.

To install simply drag the folder named "InfiniteResources" into your mods folder of your AutoForge install directory. This should be located at "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\AutoForge\mods". You can manually create this folder if it doesn't exist.
